## gamedev.tv 2022 game jam

This is a small dungeon crawler game I made within 5 days for the https://itch.io/jam/gamedevtv-jam-2022.
It contains bugs, there was not much time to polish it.

What you can see / learn in this repository:

- Use of StateMachines to control behavior of game objects
- The LG sub system of my platform for localization, including random picks for the knight's messages when something happens
- The Animation sub system of my platform to animate elements in the scene without the static sequence system of GameMaker
- Use of Controller objects
- Heavy us of @JujuAdams scribble library for text animation
- Room transition through a FadeController object that dynamically changes parameters of effect layers
-
