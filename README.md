This is a small dungeon crawler game I made within 5 days for the [gamedev.tv 2022 Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gamedevtv-jam-2022).

It contains bugs, there was not much time to polish it.

# The Story
![sprOneKnightAlone](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19487451/170858501-fd5ea37c-7ee3-4731-8d46-b6094bb0dcdf.png)

```
"You need to stay just for one night,
but you must enter alone. 
Treasure beyond imagination await you,
and... other... things... might await you, too.
Come in and find out!"

The cloaked man spread his arm with an inviting gesture
towards the entrance portal of the castle...
With loud rattle and squeaking the drawbridge lowers
in front of my feet.

And so I accepted the challenge, unsure, what I just committed.
But I am a knight. Brave. Unbreakable.
AND I wear a golden armor! So, what can happen?
```

What you can see / learn in this repository:

- The use of StateMachines to control behavior of game objects
- The LG sub system of my platform for localization, including random picks for the knight's messages when something happens
- The Animation sub system of my platform to animate elements in the scene without the static sequence system of GameMaker
- The use of Animation Curves
- The use of Controller objects
- Heavy us of @JujuAdams [scribble](https://github.com/JujuAdams/Scribble) library for text animation
- Room transition through a FadeController object that dynamically changes parameters of effect layers
- How to open links in a new tab from a html5-runtime game in GameMaker
- Loading included files at runtime through @jujuAdams [SNAP](https://github.com/JujuAdams/SNAP) library

My platform (the _indievidual_ and _packages_ folders in the project) will be published open source as a project template containing the (in my oppinion) must-have libraries in their most recent release as a project template for GameMaker.
I'll update the link to the template repo here when this step is finished.
