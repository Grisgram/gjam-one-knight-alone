Saveable
========

The Saveable object is a base object, containing function prototypes you may override (redefine),
and also two user events that get invoked before data is written on save and after it has been loaded.
It acts as a base class for all objects that shall be contained in a save game.
In the Tools folder you find a script name Savegame. This script contains functions that iterate
over all "Saveable" objects and create a json structure of them.

NOTE: Saving Saveable objects to a file can always iterate only over the current room and persistant objects!

Global variables are available if you need to test, whether a load or save operation is currently in progress:
SAVEGAME_SAVE_IN_PROGRESS
SAVEGAME_LOAD_IN_PROGRESS
Both are boolean and only true while the named operation runs.
