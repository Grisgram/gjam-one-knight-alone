<!--
	Somehow, the embedding of itch.io breaks the start of my browser game.
	This redirect points to my own webspace, where the game runs without any issues.
	Sorry for that, but I didn't have the time to sort out technical issues with itch.io
	in the short period available.
	
	The linked source code from github is 1:1 the running version. Promised.
	No addons, no hidden things - my webspace just hosts the game, because itch can't,
	for whatever reason.
